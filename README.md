# OpenMiro â€” Team Collaboration Project

**OpenMiro** is a small, fully responsive web project developed as part of our **first team collaboration exercise**.  
We selected a free design template from the **Figma Community** and adapted it into a live web application to practice real-world development workflows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

This project was specifically created to help us:

- Experience **professional team collaboration** using GitHub.
- Understand **Git workflows** including branching, pull requests, conflict resolution, and merge management.
- Practice **agile task management** and **professional communication** within a team environment.
- Learn to organize a project with **clean, modular, and scalable code**.
- Solve **real-time technical issues** collaboratively, such as code conflicts and deployment hurdles.
- Strengthen our knowledge of **responsive web design** and **UI/UX principles** by implementing a real-world layout.
- Simulate a **professional development environment** and evaluate both **individual** and **team performance**.

**OpenMiro** represents the **first step** in our journey toward becoming better developers and more effective collaborators.
